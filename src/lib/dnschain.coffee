# we don't 'use strict' because i really want to be able to use 'eval' to declare variables

###

design:

- configuration:
    - local in ~/.dnschain
    - global in /etc/dnschain
    - support command line providing configuration (overrides both of the above)
    - options:
        - everything in exports.defaults
        - logging options for bunyan

- usage
    - systemd background daemon
    - CLI usage for quick testing

- code
    - design code in a modular library-friendly way in case
      someone wants to use DNSChain in a library or to have multiple DNSChain
      servers on the same machine (for whatever reason).


security:

- protect against DDoS DNS amplification attacks.

DNS libraries used and considered:

- dns : nodejs' dns (currently lacks ability to specify dns server for query)
- dns2: native-dns (to be merged into nodejs in the future, according to author.
        used for specifying dns servers per query)
- dnsd: well-maintained dns server. I am holding off on using it for the sake of
        simplicity(single API), but if we discover a lacking server funcionality
        in native-dns, we'll switch to it for that purpose.
