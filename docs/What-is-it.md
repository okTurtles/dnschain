# What is DNSChain?

DNSChain makes it possible to be certain that you're communicating with who you want to communicate with, and connecting to the sites that you
want to connect to, *without anyone secretly listening in on your conversations in between.*

#### DNSChain replaces X.509 PKI with the blockchain

[X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) makes and breaks today's Internet security. It's what makes your browser think ["The connection to this website is secure"](http://blog.okturtles.com/2014/02/introducing-the-dotdns-metatld/) when [it's not](http://okturtles.com/#not-secure). It's what we have to get rid of, and DNSChain provides a scalable, distributed, and decentralized replacement that doesn't depend on untrustworthy
third-parties.

DNSChain provides security properties that are opposite of X.509. In X.509, _the more Certificate Authorities there are, the less secure all SSL/TLS connections are._ On the other hand, the more DNSChain servers one queries, the more likely it is one will have accurate information.

#### MITM-proof *all* Internet connections

> **"One Pin To Rule Them All"**

Connections between DNSChain and the clients it serves are **MITM-proofed** through the well-known technique of **[public-key pinning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Certificate_pinning)**. The key difference with DNSChain is that a single pin is all that's required to MITM-proof *all other Internet connections:*

- DNSChain works side-by-side with full blockchain nodes that run
on the same server.
- Websites and individuals store their public key in a blockchain (DNSChain
supports several), and from then on that
key becomes MITM-proof.
- The latest and most correct key is sent to clients over the secure
channel between DNSChain and its clients. They are then able to establish further MITM-proof connections with the owner(s) of those key(s).

It bears emphasizing that the DNSChain server itself could be malicious, and therefore users should only query the server (or _servers_) that they have good reason to trust. If they don't have access to a trustworthy DNSChain server, they should query several independently run servers and verify that the responses match.

<a name="GPG"></a>
#### Simple and secure GPG key distribution

The blockchain is a secure, decentralized database. The information
stored in it can be read at any location around the world, and DNSChain
provides easy access to it via [a blockchain agnostic API](<#API>).

![Easily share your GPG key!](https://www.taoeffect.com/includes/images/twitter-gpg-s.jpg)

Any DNSChain server can be used to retrieve the same information. Storing information in the blockchain is a bit more difficult, but with time, this too will become simple.

<a name="API"></a>
#### RESTful API to Any Blockchain

okTurtles is working with Onename to develop [a spec](https://github.com/okTurtles/openname-specifications/blob/resolvers/resolvers.md) for RESTful access to blockchains. Here's what it looks like:

    https://api.example.com/v1/namecoin/key/id%2Fbob
    https://api.example.com/v1/bitcoin/addr/MywyjpyBbFTsHkevcoYnSaifShG2Et8R3S
    https://api.example.com/v1/namecoin/key/id%2Fclinton/transfer?to_addr=ea3df...
    http://api.example.com/v1/resolver/fingerprint

The URL follows this pattern:

    /{version}/{chain|resolver}/{resource}/{property}/{operation}{resp_format}?{args}

###### Secret: You can even access traditional DNS via this API!

DNSChain lets you access [traditional DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN) records over HTTP! Note that DNS, unlike blockchains, is not secure, so even though you might be accessing it over a MITM-proof channel _to DNSChain_, there's little preventing DNSChain's access to the rest of the old DNS system from being MITM'd.

Still, if for some reason you need it, it's there:

    GET https://api.example.com/v1/icann/key/okturtles.com
    => {"version":"0.0.1","header":{"datastore":"icann"},"data":{"edns_options":[],"answer":[{"name":"okturtles.com","type":1,"class":1,"ttl":299,"address":"192.184.93.146"}],"authority":[],"additional":[]}}

<a name="Free"></a>
#### Free SSL certificates become possible

Certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) can be undermined by thousands of entities
(other CAs, their employees, governments, and hackers).

It does not matter whether you pay $300 per year for the fancy green bar in a browser or $0/year, your website's visitors [can still be attacked](http://okturtles.com/#not-secure).

Together, DNSChain and the blockchains it works with replace CAs by providing a means for distributing public keys in a way that is secure from MITM attacks. Because of this, free self-signed certificates can be used. Unlike
CAs, users are given actual reason to trust DNSChain: they choose the server
they trust (their own, or a friend's).

<a name="DDoS"></a>
#### Prevents DDoS attacks

Unlike traditional DNS servers, DNSChain encourages widespread deployment of the server (ideally, "one for every group of friends", similar to how people rely on personal routers today).
This distributed, flat topology eliminates the need for open resolvers by making it practical to limit clients to a small, trusted set.
Additionally, whereas traditional DNS resolvers must query other DNS servers to answer queries, blockchain-based DNS resolvers have no
such requirement because *all* of the data necessary to answer queries is stored locally on the server.

Another DoS attack relates to the centralized manner in which today's SSL certificates are checked for revocation:

<a name="Revocation"></a>
#### Certificate revocation that actually works

The wonderful thing about blockchains is that they *have no conception of revocation* because they do not need one. Instead, the most recent value for any particular key in a blockchain is the most accurate and up-to-date value.

TODO: [Explain OCSP](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7556909) and DoS plays a role in it.

<a name="Censorship"></a>
#### DNS-based censorship circumvention

The developers of [Unblock.us.org](https://github.com/SGrondin/unblock.us.org) and DNSChain are teaming up to bring the anti-censorship features of Unblock.us into DNSChain. Each project benefits from the other: DNSChain ensures MITM-free communication and Unblock.us ensures that the communication passes through firewalls.

The Unblock.us feature is optional and is up to the server administrator to enable and configure to their needs. It uses MITM to defeat censorship at its own game.

Unblock.us works by hijacking the DNS lookups for the domains on a list defined by the server administrator. The server then accepts all HTTP and HTTPS traffic addressed to those domains and forwards it intelligently. Even though it can't decrypt SSL traffic, it can still forward it. It's as fast as a VPN (unlike Tor) and ONLY tunnels the traffic to those domains, meaning that it doesn't affect other online activites (unlike VPNs and Tor) and isn't costly in server bandwidth. Finally, there's no software to install, only DNS settings to change. It has been confirmed to work in Turkey, UK, Kuwait, UAE and many additional Middle Eastern countries.

For now, Deep Packet Inspection techniques used in Pakistan and China can still beat Unblock.us, but the next version will address that issue using a technique called [Host Tunneling](http://unblock.us.org/?p=61). Short of cutting entire countries off the internet, DNSChain/Unblock.us will be able to get through.

<a name="Features"></a>
#### Other features: testing suite, rate-limiting, and caching

- DNSChain's tests cover all the core functionality and [excellent code coverage](https://okturtles.com/other/coverage.html).
- Protects against DNS amplification attacks with built-in rate-limiting features for __both__ DNS and HTTP requests that are [completely configurable](How-do-I-run-my-own.md#configuration).
- Supports caching of both DNS and HTTP responses via Redis. Also [configurable](How-do-I-run-my-own.md#configuration) to your liking.

<a name="metaTLD"></a>
#### The `.dns` metaTLD

metaTLDs are useful when you need to talk to the DNS server you're connected to, but do not have access to DNS information. This makes them very useful whenever browser extensions, or other software environments where access to DNS is not simple.

Note that metaTLDs cannot be "registered" because they resolve to the DNS server that the user is connected to, if that server supports metaTLDs.
